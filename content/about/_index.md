I'm a **fractional technology and product leader** who specializes in unlocking business success by building lean, innovative, and cohesive product engineering teams.

I help companies build products that scale by combining deep technical expertise with strategic product thinking. My approach focuses on creating high-performing teams that deliver meaningful impact while maintaining engineering excellence.

As co-founder of [Imperium Drive](https://imperiumdrive.com/), I pioneered a human-in-the-loop approach to autonomous driving and launched [Fetch](https://fetchcar.io) - Europe's first commercial tele-driven car hire service. We solved hard inter-disciplinary problems across domains such as low-latency live video streaming, resilient networking, automotive control systems, and Human-Machine Interfaces for safety critical systems.

Previously, I spent a decade at leading [R&D](https://www.bell-labs.com/#gref "Bell Labs Paris") [labs](https://www.huawei.com/ch-en/corporate-information/huawei-europe "Huawei Munich Research Center") and [technology](https://www.nokia.com/networks/ "Nokia Siemens Networks") companies developing novel communication systems and network protocols.

I'm always on the lookout for new ideas, opportunities for collaboration or simply connecting with interesting/driven/curious folks. Feel free to contact me at sandip(dot)gangakhedkar(at)gmail(dot)com.
