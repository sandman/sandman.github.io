    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>
      Over the last 18 years, I've had a rich and diverse career spanning research, product development, and entrepreneurship. 
      My journey has taken me from cutting edge applied research at world-class labs to co-founding a deep tech mobility startup that pushed the boundaries of what's possible in technology.
      
      I'm currently leading product engineering at Meshh, a location intelligence platform for live events, HQ'ed in London, UK. 
      
      Prior to that, I co-founded <a href="https://imperiumdrive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imperium Drive</a>, where we pioneered a human-in-the-loop approach to autonomous driving and launched <a href="https://fetchcar.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fetch</a> - Europe's first commercial tele-driven car hire service in the UK.

      Before that, I spent a decade at leading R&D labs and technology companies, including Bell Labs, Huawei, and Nokia, where I developed novel communication systems and network protocols.
      My work has been driven by a passion for solving complex problems and delivering innovative solutions that make a real impact.
    </p>  
      
    <h2>My Approach - People, Process and Product</h2>

    <p>
      I believe that enduring business success comes from a combination of the right people, effective processes, and a relentless focus on delivering value through products.

      My approach is centered around building high-performing teams that are empowered to innovate and solve complex problems.
      I emphasize a culture of experimentation, where teams are encouraged to learn from both successes and failures
      to continuously improve and adapt.

      I also focus on creating efficient processes that enable teams to deliver quickly and effectively, while maintaining high standards of quality and reliability.
      This includes leveraging modern development practices, tools, and methodologies to streamline workflows and enhance collaboration.

      Finally, I am passionate about building products that truly meet the needs of users and drive business outcomes.
      I work closely with teams to ensure that products are not only technically sound but also aligned with user needs and market demands.
      This involves a deep understanding of the problem space, user research, and a commitment to delivering value at every stage of the product lifecycle.

      As co-founder of <a href="https://imperiumdrive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imperium Drive</a>, I pioneered a human-in-the-loop approach to autonomous driving and launched <a href="https://fetchcar.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fetch</a> - Europe's first commercial tele-driven car hire service. We solved hard inter-disciplinary problems across domains such as low-latency live video streaming, resilient networking, automotive control systems, and Human-Machine Interfaces for safety critical systems.
