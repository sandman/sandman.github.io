      As co-founder of <a href="https://imperiumdrive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imperium Drive</a>, I pioneered a human-in-the-loop approach to autonomous driving and launched <a href="https://fetchcar.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fetch</a> - Europe's first commercial tele-driven car hire service. We solved hard inter-disciplinary problems across domains such as low-latency live video streaming, resilient networking, automotive control systems, and Human-Machine Interfaces for safety critical systems.
