		<h2>How I help</h2>
		<p>
			I partner with founders and leadership teams to bridge the gap between business strategy and product execution. 
			My approach combines extensive technical and execution experience with cross-functional understanding to help companies grow and flourish.
			Depending on the situation, I can step in to fix immediate challenges or work alongside your team to build long-term capabilities. 
			I am not a "coach" - I roll up my sleeves and get things done.
